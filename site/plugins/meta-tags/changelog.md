# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2017-03-01
The plugin has gone under heavy refactor and is no longer focused only on Open Graph. For that reason the name has changed from Open Graph to Meta Tags.

Although this is a beta release, it is considered stable and should cover most use cases, even complex ones.

## [1.0.0-alpha] - 2017-02-26
### Initial release
